# AltiUno
Firmware for the 1 pyro output altimeter using an ATMega 85 microcontroller
An altimeter that fire a charge at apogee and beep the apogee altidude after deploying the parachute. This is really ideal for replacing the motor ejection.
For this one because I wanted to make it smaler I used an ATtiny 85.
