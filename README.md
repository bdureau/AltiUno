# AltiUno
Firmware for the 1 pyro output altimeter using an ATMega 85 microcontroller
An altimeter that fire a charge at apogee and beep the apogee altidude after deploying the parachute. This is really ideal for replacing the motor ejection.
For this one because I wanted to make it smaler I used an ATtiny 85.
The original version uses a BMP085 pressure sensor

The latest version uses a BMP180 pressure sensor, however the code is identical

An smt board using the same code also exist and can be used in smaller rocket.
